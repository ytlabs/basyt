                    <h4 class="service-heading">OK, what is basyt then?</h4>
                    <p>It is a package of patterns that extends capabilities of expressjs that will make you develop your API server quicker.</p>
                    <h4 class="service-heading">Is it a nodejs web framework?</h4>
                    <p>Nope, it is not. It actually tries hard not to be a framework. Being a framework and providing simplicity contradicts, and basyt prefers to be in the simplicity side.</p>
                    <h4 class="service-heading">Do I really need basyt?</h4>
                    <p>Well, if you have more than a few entities, you do not want to repeat yourself while writing database operations, validations and authorization services, then it may be.</p>
                    <p>But if you have more simple API needs, do not bother using any additional packages, expressjs itself is probably more than enough for you</p>
                    <h4 class="service-heading">And the name means?</h4>
                    <p>In Turkish <i>basit</i> means <i>simple</i>. That is the motivation: an extension over expressjs to make things simpler. Since our company's initials are YT, we decided to call the project <b>basyt</b>, simple web package from Yonca Teknoloji.</p>
